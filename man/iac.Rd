\usage{
iac(x, groups, zcutoff = -3, niter = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix where features are represented by rows and observations by columns.}

\item{groups}{optional vector of group membership for each column of \code{x}.}

\item{zcutoff}{z-score cutoff for outlier detection (default = -3).}

\item{niter}{number of iterations (default = 3).}
}
\value{
a matrix of IAC distances with iterations listed in rows.
}
\description{
Inter-Array Correlation (IAC) method for outlier detection.
The idea behind IAC is to measure the average correlation between each
observation and the rest of the dataset and then mark the observations with
low average correlation as potential outliers.
}
\details{
Technically the function first calculates the average correlation for each
available observation and then transforms those correlations into z-scores.
Only rows with no missing values are used for estimating the correlation
coefficients. For the next iteration all the observations with z-scores
below the specified cutoff will not be included in the calculations of mean
and standard deviation. However, the actual average correlation for those
observations will still be displayed and transformed into a z-score,
reflecting its distance (in standard deviations) from the rest of the group.

When \code{groups} argument is provided the IAC procedure is performed for
each group separately. When no observations fall below the specified z-score
threshold the z-score values returned by the current iteration will be the
same as those returned by the previous iteration.
}
\examples{
# a toy dataset
dat <- data.matrix(t(iris[,-5]))

# 10 iterations with standard deviation cutoff of -2
res <- iac(dat, zcutoff = -2, niter = 10)

# only the iterations that found additional outliers
unique(res)
